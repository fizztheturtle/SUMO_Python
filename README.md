# Efficient Detour Computation Scheme for Electric Vehicles (EV) â€“Python/SUMO
Reviewed and implemented detouring algorithms into a realistic traffic simulator, using real world data to justify the findings. The simulator required a python script, where the various mathematical equations were implemented as code and ran through the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) application. Completing this project gave me confidence in my ability to apply decision mathematics to solve complex issues, further developing my analytical and problem-solving abilities.
